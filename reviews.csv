  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren‚Äôt working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren‚Äôt working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don‚Äôt regret after.

  This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn‚Äôt record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon ! Don‚Äôt play with people‚Äôs hard earned money . Guys stay away from this Apple days sale .

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs.

  If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off.I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

  This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

  This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

  I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren‚Äôt functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people‚Äôs complaints.

  The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz .

  If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS!

  Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. üò≠Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone.

  Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!

  My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS.

Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

  Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware.

  From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

  Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.

  Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.

  Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-‚Ä¢Wide angle camera‚Ä¢Supports fast Charing‚Ä¢Stunning looks‚Ä¢Superb Camera quality‚Ä¢Safe and secure device ‚Ä¢Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-‚Ä¢The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp‚Ä¢Still have huge notch‚Ä¢Bit costly in India

  The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn‚Äôt respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it‚Äôs been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it‚Äôs the worst product from Apple. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it‚Äôs not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn‚Äôt work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don‚Äôt find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.

  I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don‚Äôt have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons.

  it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time

  Keeping the review of the item aside. Never buy any costly items on the ecomm sites.Detail Explanation of problems faced:I bought the iPhone 11 128GB Black during Amazon big billion days happened between 16 Oct 2020 to 22 Oct 2020. Orderd on 16 Oct 2020 and it got delived on 18 Oct 2020. As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre.

  I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years.Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.

  If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:1. Video recording doesnt have pause button2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper15. No battery % on the notification bar16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?But hey. I get to show off my new iphone ü§¨

  Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up üëç¬† for that.Let me talk a little about the phone üì±. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.‚úÖ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.‚úÖ All-day battery life.‚úÖ A great degree of water & dust resistance.‚úÖ Wireless charging‚úÖ An extra ultra-wide camera‚úÖ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)‚úÖ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product.

  The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn‚Äôt up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung‚Äôs A 30‚Äôs which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can‚Äôt help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo‚Äôs with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn‚Äôt take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would‚Äôve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!

  This is the most unusual experience I ever had with an Apple product. I ordered the iPhone 11 Black, 128 GB, the top portion of the Touchscreen was not working at all. Further, got it replaced with another iPhone in the replacement. The second phone that arrived was also defective. The speakers of the phone were super defective. It was highly evident that the product is defective. Had no option but to return the product and buy the phone at a higher cost with Vijay sales. Appario Brand retailers are supposed to be the best in the business. But two defective iPhones in two days is surely an issue. Really bad experience with iPhone Products. Had to gift the phone to my dad on his birthday. Made my dad sad. No Electronics products for me from Amazon now.

  This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

  I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúrepaired tag‚Äù in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can‚Äôt demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don‚Äôt know what Apple is going to do.In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.

  Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life.

  Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.

  Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it . I was an android user from the very beginning . My first android phone was moto g first gen then came oneplus 3t , asus zenfon 5z , and at last black shark 2 . Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it

  It's a bad buying experience from Amazon as they are not giving Amazon pay cashback as stated by their offer. Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting fine details of terms and conditions of the offer in so many places that you cant take screenshots of every place to get complete offer details handy with you and their usual cashback will come to one account after sales end. So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.Soon seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images iphone I doubt anyone can match that. But as per my experience It's better to buy it offline after checking it personally, spending few thousand bucks makes more sense rather than risking much larger amount. I am lucky phone comes out as original but I have heard about many fraud cases from both Amazon and Flipkart. So choose wisely

  The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.Pros -- Camera is Amazing- Water-resistant- 4K Recording- Fluid Smooth touch- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming- And 100s of more ProsCons -- Haven't found any yet !!!So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device.

  Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.

  After  5 years of loyalty towards OnePlus and 8years towards Android, Finally moved to an IPhone after all the intense brainstorming and research and the obvious Skepticism around different news floating around questioning its authenticity.For me, the seller was Darshita Electronics (All my 8phones to date has come from this seller and all of them were 100% genuine.About Iphone 11 128GB White, neatly packaged and delivered,To do's to check if the phone is Original,1. Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaultsWhat did I like about this phone?1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective7.  Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online storeWhat is not present but doesn't make difference?1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS153. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fineRecommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.

  The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didn‚Äôt like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and won‚Äôt be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care can‚Äôt connect with a person and their automated options doesn‚Äôt cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.

  Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.Pros:1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?Cons:1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.4. Read the terms and conditions ofApple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance.

  Nothing to dislike about the product and seller.Security: I only hope that apple will come up with an iOS update to add option for those wanting to disable swipe after the phone is unlocked with Face ID.Camera quality: Could see visible grains in photos taken even during daylight as compared to the photos taken from iPhone 5s even though it‚Äôs without crisp details. iPhone 11 boasts of camera features, else the picture quality isn‚Äôt impressive. Video quality is good though.Battery: It‚Äôs not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly. So, it will go about an entire day in moderate usage without much to play.Voice assistant: Siri is few seconds slower to respond to ‚ÄòHey Siri.‚ÄôSound: Sounds good while watching videos. Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom.

  iPhone11 Review A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I‚Äôve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I  thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.  One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‚Äòpicture in Picture‚Äô in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.  Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.  Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.  Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing ‚Äúcontinuity feature‚Äù that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.  Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but,  my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.

  An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am. And also got it same at my residance with very speedily on 18th in safe n  superb packing.But after inserting sim card i hv noticed that incoming call ringer volume was not working,  i hv contacted APPLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM, they tried to resolve the problem,  through screen sharing,  they hv tried,  there level the best,  but couldn't get successed and saying that this is product manufacturing defect and advised to contact apple service centre, with sending me a (service centre) link, which was 400km away from  my residence.i explained my inability to opt it, hence he advised to contact AMAZON from which it was purchased .Then i hv contacted AMAZONE, customer service centre, described all these, then via via via an authorised executive talked with me,  explaining all the details and requested to help me out. He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards.  I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period  i hv  purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)Otherwise I could purchased  iphone 11 from apple store,  it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a  cutomer of AMAZONE.If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not  be possible for replacement.Salute to AMAZONE. I AM HIGHLY OBLIGED.Bharat Mansata.

Already have an iPad and AirPods and connections are seamless across products- Great for work and productivity- Siri Shortcuts is great for creating workflowsCons:- Not great for media consumption. Screen resolution is a little over 720p- Camera is great. But as of now I haven‚Äôt been able to use it to click better photos than I did on my previous phone (OnePlus 7).

  After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.

  Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.  Some other good features: - Stereo speakers with great quality. - iOS provides smooth user experience. - The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good. - Amazing video quality - Excellent selfie photos.Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine.

  First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ‚úåüèº

  I got received fresh box packing and manufacturing nov month. I heard many rumors for fake iphone delivered from Amazon.  But i don't think they do this cheap work. So without hesitate u can place order from Amazon. I have used some days this product then i feel on hand its awesome. I have listened music earphones and stereo speakers. Very loudly sound and every beats are crisp and clear.Camera quality are awesome no doubt. Display quality is decent  and battery life is also decent. Approx 1 day uses with normal uses. Face id is more secure. But i got face one issue. In this Pandemic, the mask has to come down again and again whenever the phone has to be unlocked. So they should give In fingerprint displays. This is safe feature in this pandemic.Along with the phone, they should also provide a charger. Because you take so much money, you still cannot provide charger, even that big company!Overall the phone is good, you can buy.

  So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.Hope with new release they will match with android.Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don‚Äôt even think of it.

  Amazon and appario retail did a good job.I received a apple factory sealed package.But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.

  I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.

  Dear Amazon Support/Customer Care,This ls to write and bring to your notice regarding the extremely bad quality of product and support provided by Amazon.To brief you about the situation, I bought an apple iphone-11 from Amazon and not from any other platform because of the trust on Amazon and it's great support team. But this time around, it was a completely opposite situation. After receiving the product on 30.10.2020, the product was discolored ( like damage); I immediately tried to replace the product through the options available on the app, but the app would just direct me back to the link of apple support website and contact number. After several tries, I final got through the apple support, only to be redirected to the apple store. On reaching the apple Stores during the limited stringent work hours, I was asked to come the next day. On the next day, I was informed that this issue needs to be taken up by Amazon only.After being extremely tired of this entire long process, with great difficulty, I could connect with the Amazon customer support. The customer support assured me of resolving the issue and asked me to wait for 24 hours to get a call.Post this, it has already been more than 40 hours and I m yet to receive any call. Furthermore, when I am trying to call the same number, I fail to connect despite repeated tries. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of your product and support; which is least expected from Amazon.Today being my last day of eligible replacement, I write to you with the Last hope of some relief.I expect atleast this time around Amazon will help its long loyal customer, who is losing faith in the quality of Amazon.

All the apps, photos, songs etc. get transferred directly for the old device to the new device. No need for backup and restore. Then transfer the SIM from your old phone to the new phone and you are all set. Seamless!!!

  After reading the reviews I completely scared about the authenticity of the phone. I would like to thanks to all people who made me aware in such a way that Firstly I verified my phone before even putting the SIM card.I got the brand new iPhone with no technical or physical glitches. Thanks to Amazon and apparition retail.Phone is working flawlessly. Registered on Apple site and got warranty of one year.Rest of the features are already described.

  Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8. It feels like degradation for me from bigger and more clear display to small LCD with no refresh rate. Major pain area is battery charging from 15mins of oneplus to hours for iPhone. Feature rich shortcut in oneplus to static options like no shortcut for turning on or off location.

  Pros -1. All the benefits of an iPhone. (Superb ios experience, smoothness, speed, touchscreen etc etc etc)2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage.3. Sound is loud.Cons:-1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ‚Çπ1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you.2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold.Iphone x - 174 gmsIphone xs - 177 gmsIphone 11 - 193.3 gmsIphone 12 - 162.4 gms

  Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don‚Äôt have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It‚Äôs a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .Overall not satisfied

  I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  üòÖThis is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. üòçüòç

If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.

  I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...

  Mobile device is good. Good upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected.  I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn‚Äôt hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.

In terms of performance phone nailed in that but only one problem I think I must include here is if you play PUBG or any heavy game like that phone heats not that much but it heats everyone is here complaining about heating problems trust me phone not heat while normal usage only when you play heavy graphics game like PUBG cod fort nite.

  iPhone - the name is enough to guarantee buttery smooth performance, with years of guaranteed OS updates (Android, looking at you. I struggled to get the monthly updates for weeks on your own brand Pixel phones, forget about the flashy Samsung and Xiaomi/OnePlus etc.). Amazing camera, no bloatware or selling customer data to third parties (again Android, looking at you. You give the OS for free and make the customer the product to push ads for revenue). After years of being a committed Android user, from the time Nokia/Microsoft stopped making Windows smartphones, for almost 6+years, finally decided being taken for a ride by Google/Android. Well, was using the iPhone 6s for about an year along with my Google Pixel 2 XL, but now Apple iPhone is my only daily driver, and the way things are looking between Apple and Google and how they are focused on business in India, its going to be an iPhone always for me, for the foreseeable future.

  I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.

  Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give ‚Äúamazing user experience‚Äù then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.ü§ò.

  Superb. It‚Äôs a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don‚Äôt think I will be needing anything else.

  Easily the best overall mobile phone for nearly two years now, and with good reason. Gifted a purple one to my mother. She was using a Oneplus X for a few years, and she loves the 11.

  After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.It‚Äôs my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It‚Äôs camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don‚Äôt work with a mask.

  I have been using 6s for past ~5yrs and made an economical swicth to Iphone 11, to stick to the simplified OS. For god sake, I could see so many cons in comparison with 6s, regretting my upgrade1. Heavy!, expected, when I have switched from 6s, but its too heavy when compared to other phones of this size. May the same reason, ip12 is lighter2. WIFI reception. ip6s did a very good job. almost at every part of my house, it was able to gather good signal. but ip11 literally struggles to even stay connected with WIFI at corners. it makes continuous switch between WIFI/cellular, annoys to to move to a different location. tried even with out the cover on.3. Speakers at the bottom. I was thinking both the grill openings at the bottom were speakers. it turned out, i could hear music from only one of them. even i have planned to visit apple care to get the mobile checked. had some instinct to check it online before going, by then i was able find in apple discussions, that its microphone with speaker like grill.4. Sound output - both through wired/wireless headphones. i could not hear anything in an crowded environment.  even tried with multiple good earphones, the output is very low. this even a low end phone can do a better job. this might force me to move to a new phone may be.And most imp is the call history, you cannot have more than 100 call records.. not sure, why apple have this policy. you gonna really miss some imp numbers, when we really get busy with continuous calls. And you cannot record your voice calls, when it‚Äôs really needed like in other ecosystem!Feel, these are very basic setback to even consider it as a good phone. would definately not recommend anyone for ip11, rather would recommend ip12(if one can afford) or ip6s, if they could find in second hand market.(Yes, the size is small, but that does a better job). Even the former one, I'm not sure, as I haven't used hands-on.

  I bought my iphone 11 64gb red variant from the seller Darshita Electronics. The product came in a bubble wrap, securely sealed. I cross checked if it was genuine by going to apple website and validating serial number details, and it was an authentic product given to me! Quite impressed with their fast delivery.Regarding any further review, will have to use it and see...So far so good.

  Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ‚Çπ46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ‚Çπ68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ‚Çπ23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:

  I was looking for a phone which is fast while opening phone and message apps and in general. Phones under 30k had performance issues. In 50k range Samsung and Oneplus were Android choices. But I did not like their software experience even after spending that much. My wife is using iphone7 for last 3 years and till this date it feels fast so I went ahead with iphone 11 and it is a solid phone overall.

  Very much satisfied about the purchase. Was a little concerned about whether I would be getting genuine product or not, but kudos to the seller (Darshita electronics), they kept my trust. Got a September manufactured made in India unit as well. Every accessory working fine and no heating issues as well. Only heats up a little with my 20 Watts fast charger. I would recommend not to use the fast charger on daily basis. It‚Äôs okay to use it sometimes when you are in a hurry. Otherwise use the regular 5 Watts slow charger. Apple has provided that because of a reason. Only concern is with apple not amazon, which is the cable quality. Very very poor quality which starts to chip off within a few months. So due to sale, i ordered the Belkin cable for charging as it is best in class and MFI certified. Would recommend to use only good quality MFI cables if you want long life for your phone. Other than that, camera quality is top notch and always seems to improve with every software update. Battery life is epic, lasts a full day although I don‚Äôt do gaming on iphone, still I am quite a heavy user.Very very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon and Darshita electronics. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)

  I bought the iPhone 11 128gb white and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Pros:BatteryCameraDisplayProcessorCons:The charger provided is only of 5W.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here.

  I‚Äôm writing this after one month of using it.Battery 5/5 - so far the best I have seen on a phone both android or iosCamera: 4.5/5 - honestly this is the best camera out of all iPhone till 11 (excluding the pro models). One thing which I was expecting was to control shutter speed atleast in the night mode settings it only gives me pre defined options.Display: 4/5 even though you wont be able to see individual pixels, still would have been a tad better it the pixel density was little more atleast better than xrPerformance: 5/5 No doubt every iphone release breaks the previous record

  I generally don't prefer to buy any expensive electronic gadgets like iPhone from any e-commerce portal. I read many negative comments from the reviews section. My plan was to buy iPhone11 128 Gig and particularly Yellow color. I checked the Amazon Sale price and the market price and the difference was 5k INR. I still wanted to buy from the nearest apple authorized retailer but there was some technical issue with the HDFC card and I could not buy it. Then after thinking so much, I tried to buy from Amazon sale on 16th-Oct-2020. The iPhone arrives and I checked the product is fully compliance and 100% genuine. I got full 1 year apple warranty and the product model number. And the best thing is my iPhone is Make in India. I am loving it :) ...

The processor is way advanced than any android out there. Privacy and security definitely better than android.

  If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don‚Äôt always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it‚Äôs always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ‚Çπ1500 to ‚Çπ2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that‚Äôs the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice

  I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.Pros:1. Superb processor-  My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applicationsCons:1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.

After making the customer wait for 1 week , this is what they come up.

  At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:Cons1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.6. This phone is heavy.7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. üòâü§´You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.Pros1. Battery backup is super in my usage.2. Camera's were as hyped.3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.5. IP68 rating a must have.If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.

  I LOVE IT üòåI mean now I can finally understand why everyone is so crazy about iPhones! Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won‚Äôt regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :)About the battery life, it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!

  After few months of waiting and research about which phone would suit me the best, I bought this in 2020.I think there isn‚Äôt a single phone that would work for everyone, they all have different expectations and needs. I was looking for a phone that‚Äôs water resistant, takes really good videos, has powerful processing, has better than average battery life, has magnetic sensor for better navigation and provides good user experience while using the phone. Stereo speakers was an add-on. Basically, this phone has fulfilled all my expectations.

  Like most of the people i too was worried about the product. What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZONComing to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.The phone is incredibly beautiful.Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.Will be updating more with coming days.......üôÇ

  This is my first iphone. After using android for so long didn't exoect to like ios so much. So yes ios is more refined compared to android. Iphone is costly yes but now a days highend android and iphone doesnt have much difference in terms of price. But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league. I dont need customisation so i am liking ios better. But if u are more into customization thing then u may go for android. And final verdict.. Iphn 11 is a complete package and a real value for money. I really enjoy using it.

  I had iPhone 6s and it‚Äôs been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this.  unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.

  I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Apple üçé

  Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it‚Äôs mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it‚Äôs little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.

  Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.Pros: 1. Best battery life in an iPhone  - 3110 mAh2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)12. Premium feel phone13. Its an iphone14. Good resale valueCons:1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)2. Minor software limitations as compared to android3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.Conclusion:I would personally rate this at 9.5/10If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it‚Äôs as easy as thatAnd as for me, I‚Äôm very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.

  First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested.Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price.IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.

We‚Äôll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it‚Äôs literally a beast in all aspects

  ¬†Quality not adequate. Camera quality is worst. Video recorder doesn't have pause button hence you need to buy extra app and after spending money on that app you're gonna get cheap quality videos. I couldn't return because of limitations. But it's not worth spending 66k for this phone. My one plus 5t has far far better quality of camera and has all required features. In short I would like to tell that I'm extremely disappointed after purchasing this phone

  1st time bought an apple product, fully different experience. The OS is not user friendly like android but it's interesting.The camera quality is quite impressive. The night camera is also good, but there is a little issue which I was not supposed, and ie. when you move ur hand or any non-living object it blurs the image and I was supposing that iPhone will fix it... But the sensor is very good... face detection is awesome...

  The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‚Äòin-house‚Äô card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.

  Upgraded from iPhone 6s, I am totally happy with my new iPhone 11. Everything meets perfection on Apple as always, and the Camera is exceptional. Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app.Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.

  To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus.It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!

  Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours.

I was very apprehensive about shifting to iOS as I was told android is much more flexible and I will not be able to adjust to Apple. My phone got delivered before time, I charged it and started using it by afternoon. Took a couple of hours for data transfer and by evening I was completely in love with this phone. Was amazed by the interface and no nonsense whatsoever kind of vibe from this phone. I also got it at a very reasonable price from amazon shopping festival. Thank you Amazon and Apple !

  Honestly the feel of phone, colors in it is extremely standard. This may not have OLED screen but honestly the quality is top-notch. However if it had OLED, it would be much more battery efficient.This is first time for me to have an iphone as recently I switched from android. I am switching from k20 pro that had OLED and 90 Hz display. Honestly 60 Hz is the only thing on this phone that bugged me else screen is brilliant. Gaming is fire smooth.Camera is too damn good. Extremely detailed to be precise. I have never used the camera of a phone before this much. Night mode pictures are clearly to fall in love with. If you buy quick charger you are then set to use it.

  I got it for 48.5k (128 GB version) and at this price point its a an excellent product (compare it with oneplus 9 but will beat it on performance, longevity and camera from in case if these are your priorities). Its a real value for money when compared to iphone 12 mini (upwards of 65K+ for 128GB but smaller battery) and iphone 12 (80k+ for 128GB variant). You wont miss much on camera and performance front. True that the new boxy design is sexier and the screen has improved. But the premium you have to pay is too big (around 20k).P.S: I would strongly suggest to go for 128 GB version irrespective of the version of iphone. 64GB is too less and you will start to encounter space issues within six months or so (if you are a casual user).

Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.

  Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.

  Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don‚Äôt need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn‚Äôt agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don‚Äôt know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.

  I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.This is a great phone with minimal flaws.The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark roomsThe small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don‚Äôt have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product‚Äôs like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.If you‚Äôre looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.Peace

  This phone is awesome. There are lots of features which are nice.Face ID can be detected even in the dark. Battery backup is nice. Phone camera automatically adjusts to take high quality pics and the night mode is fantastic. However, I am not really happy with the front camera for taking the pics at night(May be I am not using all the options for the night mode,I need to learn more on that).Screen is responding very well on the feathery touch. I am already an iPhone user, so all the other best features of iPhone are already here.Last but not the least, I would like to thank the seller for the genuine product and fast delivery with hassle free exchange. Seen the reviews about this seller, I was bit scared but my friend also got the iPhone from this seller and now I also got it. There is no problem with this seller.

  Lured by the big discount during the sale bought an iPhone 11 128GB black phone. Extremely disappointed with amazon! You guys sent a phone with faulty screen! And there was no option of contacting customer care. All attempts were leading to Apple customer care details. Finally upon contacting the Apple customer care, they advised to take it nearest Apple service centre. The service centre was reluctant asking to contact amazon, as it was bought from amazon. The service centre guys mentioned that they have had many such compliants with regards to issues with iPhones delivered from amazon! Hope you guys are not delivering substandard and poor quality phones under the guise of discounted products!I would be henceforth very skeptical buying any high value products from amazon! Sorry to say this!

  It is an iPhone. No other words required. I like the battery life but I still think they could have made it better. No complaints though, have been using it for a month now and the performance has been awesome. Cannot compare it to an android. It is a matter of taste/preference and now that I have switched to IOS, I am not willing to leave it and switch back to android. Probably because iOS is pretty simplistic, just the way I like it.iPhones are not worth 70k I guess but I got it for 53K which is definitely worth it. It is good if you get an iPhone for around 50. Hence I decided to buy this instead of the new 12

  Best deal if you are getting it under 50k. Received it from Darshita electronics, color Green, and the product is genuine with no technical  issues. I don‚Äôt have to say about the camera as it is best in class. Battery backup is great in comparison with iphone 12 - you can get a full day with moderate usage. If you are heavy gamer then you may need to charge it twice a day , and my suggestion is to get a fast charger in this case as the current 5w charger takes 2-3 hours for a full charge. My suggestion is to buy it from a retail store (however the chances of a faulty product is nil) as it is costly affair and the return policy for apple products is not that great on Amazon, please check return policy before buying it online.

  Had bad experience with iPhone 11 charger adaptor. It stopped working after some day. I did not go to apple service center due to lockdown. Later when lockdown was over I went to apple service center and I heard shocking news about my adaptor the Resq (apple has tie-up with reliance to support apple)executive told me that the adaptor is fake one and he can not replace it. Another sock came after I checked my case id online where the executive did not mentioned that he can not provide replacement because I have fake product instead what he wisely canceled my appointment. So guys there is big scam going on apple support is not interested to fix smal issue the user has to bear all the charges for the same.

  10 months agoi've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone

  I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing.Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice.There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its  better to avoid iphone dual sim models.The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software & camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.

It got delivered in 4 days and i am completely satisfied with amazon products.  It was a new phone not refurbished or clone . And it gives a proper warranty of 1 year .Returning to product ...At starting i feel heating while setting up my phone ... i was earlier using Poco F1 so i feel some heat due to it‚Äôs glass back ... but it was not much ... slightly warmer at back because of that glass back .Battery life is very good ... but very slow charging.Camera is awesome u will love the images ... even in low light .Gaming performance is brilliant.Cone is that it‚Äôs display is slightly dull ... as its just ips lcd display.Overall u will enjoy using this phone

  So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone üò¢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.

  The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown  and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn‚Äôt not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11.

  Ordered 2 iPhone 11s. Was really scared because of all the negative reviews but took a leap of faith. Thankfully both my iPhones were original and seem to be okay. Really happy. I ordered one from Appario Retail and other from Darshita. One red, another purple. Happy with both.

  Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker.Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage.Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020.Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason.But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue.

  Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.Thanks.

  I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don‚Äôt work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.

  I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.

  Never buy such costly products from amazon. They never return it back if the product is defective or even it‚Äôs not working. I brought this iPhone 11 and found there is a small foreign particle inside its display. Amazon asked me to get it checked in Apptronics and apptronics people are not even ready to touch the phone as it is not purchased from apple store. Now I‚Äôm using the same defective device. Got a good lesson- Never buy any product above 5000 from online shopping websites.

I was upgraded from iPhone 7 and it was a great experience with all the latest specs and great battery performance. I have been using it for almost 2 months.

  So here's the review after 3 months of use, this is by far the best phone i have ever used, this is my first iphone and the experience so far is truly amazing! The battery life is good, can last at most 8 hours with minimal usage and at least 6 hours with heavy usage! Although the charger is bit slow, takes almost 3 hours to charge the iPhone completely! The user interface is really smooth and if you are switching from android to ios, there's a huge difference! The camera quality is very impressive. The face id works really well. The speakers are great and earphones are durable ! You can go ahead and buy the product even now and won't regret it ‚ô•Ô∏è

  My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it‚Äôs delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I‚Äôm the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there‚Äôs no question of sending refurbished device.Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S.  Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.Overall it‚Äôs great to have this phone.

  User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X.

  I had my doubts before buying iOS product because I‚Äôve been using Android for a very long time, I‚Äôve stock android experience so I know what kind of difference does it make from android to iOS.- iOS is real smooth! If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it‚Äôs gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps.- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids.- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you‚Äôre not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you‚Äôll still find a quality sound!-  About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it‚Äôs wonderful.The Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there.Camera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive.Though zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image.- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%.PS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life.- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good.- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021.- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it‚Äôs own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better.At the end I‚Äôd Recommend this. Even if you‚Äôre switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.

  Review here just pertains to the product I've received from Amazon. Guys, some sellers are misleading customers with refurbished products. The one I received had certain issues with speaker and camera and Amazon was not agreeing to replace the same. But did ask me to return the product and get the return instead.Please be very careful while purchasing such costly products from Amazon. It is always advisable to buy it from istore because it is no 10-12k that you are investing.

  The product is very good, color is also good no issue with the device till now as its only a day of usage, but this time i am not satisfied with the package as per amount paid for the premium product. I ordered 3 item but they sent it all together in a single box which is not acceptable. What would have happended if the product received turnsout a damaged one, i know there is a policy of replacing but it was a birthday gift, had to send back and had to wait for extra more days.

The studio light feature in the camera is supreme for portraits. Battery life is mediocre as I was using OnePlus phone before this one but the build quality is excellent.

  iPhones are always the best. But it depends on your usage when it comes to battery backup. iPhone 11 is the best ever phone I have used till date. It has the best battery of 3110 and gives the user a full day usage with enabling mobile data on all the day.  You can still buy the iPhone 11 even after the launch of iPhone 12 when you need a good battery backup.

  This is the best iPhone you‚Äôll ever get(Bought in amazon sale) for this price. I was afraid to order from amazon but that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt a prob after receiving. Think twice if you‚Äôre making switch from android, coz you‚Äôll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you‚Äôll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the ‚ÄúBattery‚Äù backup is great for an iPhone which i didn‚Äôt except. It gives you 1 and half to two days  of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don‚Äôt need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you‚Äôll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months.

The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it.

  Not much has changed. Apple has similar products but then obviously the bigger screen, better front camera and better battery life make it feel like an upgrade. The phone speaker is amazing and LOUD, especially compared to 6S. Rear camera is almost similar to 6S. But overall, I really like the phone. The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you‚Äôre a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.

Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone.

  I am writing against all the negative reviews here. I have purchased iPhone 11 from Amazon sale on 23rd of Oct. If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I  have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.

  Ordered on prime day of Amazon Great indian Festival, Oct 16th, 2020. Charger and earpods included in box. Delivered in 3 days, kudos to Amazon! Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)

  ¬†There is nothing extraordinary or something like that with the iphone compare to overall flagship android device i have been using, but the ecosystem & the iOS experience is kind of different & fluid and it's a good experience to have a Apple Device for first time. Worth for around 50k, glad i didn't go with the 85k iphone-12 not much a difference according to my usage. Battery is more than i expected, Camera quality is great when it comes to video recording, photos aren't that great.

  Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn‚Äôt quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn‚Äôt.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won‚Äôt allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ‚Çπ3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!

  ¬†Pros:I‚Äôve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.Cons:I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it‚Äôs Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it‚Äôs a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It‚Äôll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I‚Äôm always wearing a mask and cannot face id.Overall it‚Äôs a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.

  Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it.The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone.

As expected of Amazon delivery was on time and product was in excellent condition.But when I put sim inside and tried calling, distorted noice came through speaker.Calling speaker is busted. Cannot hear clear voice unless you connect earpods and worst thing is there is no replacement policy for this.

  This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.

  Overall phone is excellent. You can go for it.But one suggestion to all, don't buy any products using Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, you will be charged nicely. That too if you are choosing NO EMI COST option then gone case, get ready to pay extra charges including interest charges and GST against each installments and products. Whatever they show in calculation details (Structure) all bullshit. I nicely charged for this product by selecting EMI option and just to save 1000/- I paid extra 2000/- for this product.And I purchased one more product 'Hoodie' the cost was 799/- by using Amazon Pay ICICI Card it costed for me 942.82 including GST even though it was a one payment.So my sincere suggest don't use *Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card at all*. And don't go for any EMI options its better to buy in one payment to avoid additional charges. No body will help you once it is charged to you. ICICI Customer care they play very safe game.

  Upgrade to 11 from 7 was smooth as the data transfer took place in just a few minutes. Features of iOS14 and the battery backup are simply superb. However, since the adapter supplied is of 2W, the charging time is higher. May be wireless charger or 5W charger should be bought separately

  Readers,Earlier I was hesitant to buy an iPhone as 11 comes with LCD panel, I used to be a huge fan of OnePlus and was under the impression that 120 Hz would really make a difference but hands on heart- I‚Äôve been using my iPhone for last 3 days and I am flabbergasted at how vivid the display of iPhone is that too LCD one!Now coming to delivery- Amazon never disappointsSeller- Appario Retail, received the original product and in good condition- No complaints. IDK why other users have issues with this retailerDeal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sureDon‚Äôt worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the marketColour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for meThe only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can‚Äôt transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device.Hope my review helps in decision making!

  Its nothing new that iPhones are amazing. You can get the actual reviews on youtube easily. I would like to tell that as I switched from an Android to iOS, there is a very big change that I am experiencing. Camera quality, call clarity, every single aspect of the device is top notch. I got the 128 GB model and after installing all the necessary apps for social media, ecommerce and payments, I have around 20 GB occupied. So even the 64 GB model is great if you are not much into making videos.

  As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in üì∑ competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options.

  First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you‚Äôll face no problem there.Screen response time is very accurate there‚Äôs no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you‚Äôre not getting a charger from now it‚Äôs not bad.When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can‚Äôt enjoy  it in 720p screen but it‚Äôs there.So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it‚Äôs around 55k so definitely if you‚Äôre going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.

  I know that the 'Worlds best phone' do not need any reviews. But still, I wished I should share my thoughts and experience about it.This product was delivered within time and thanks to amazons for delivering it on time.I got it checked & verified  at the time of delivery.I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, instead I am more happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.This phone is super smooth, thanks to A13 Bionic chip, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.Camera is another best thing of iphone 11, I repeat - The Best. No competition. You will have to trust me.Talking about the design and build quality, it is great either. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.Apple have improved the sound & audio quality in iphone 11. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer.

  Pros :Touch is really smoothBattery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.IOS14 update came within 2 daysSwitching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.ConsBattery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.Overall a nice product to buy.

  100% genuine.iPhone 11- White colour,128GB, 4GB Ram, Updated to iOS 14.I ordered it about a week ago(17th Oct) and Amazon made sure that I get the choice of color and storage I ordered. Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.Owning a iPhone is a dream for many.

  Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.

  I bought this phone in feb from Amazon, it worked good till Aug with no issues. After that randomly any app used to get uninstalled like whatsapp, insta, facebook. I called apple service centre multiple to get some help on this.but they could not help and finally i visited Apple service centre and they again formatted my phone and told me there was software issue and now this issue will not happen. Again after 5 days my apps got uninstalled. I regret buying this phone.

  I switched from Android to iOS for the first time and it has been keeping me amazed! Smooth touch, responsive apps, excellent UI, mind blowing camera, I can now understand why iPhone users say something is different in it! Absolutely unbelievable experience! Cherry on top is security, use bank and payments app without any hassles! Loved it! Two drawbacks are 1) No headphone and charger (you have to shell more money üò≠) 2) No fingerprint scanner and using faceid in COVID is a PIA.

  Got this delivered today after 17 days only because it was out of stock during sale. But it's all worth the wait. No doubt iPhone is iphone.Best Premium quality phone in this price range.Got it at 46250‚Çπ during GAF sale for the 64Gb variant.This is my ever IOS experience and I know it'll take time to adjust with it. Everything seems paid in IOS but need to find a way üòÖYou'll notice the LCD screen only when you're comparing it with another OLED phone otherwise it's display is Okay!!The stereo speakers are fabulous, even the earpods sounds amazing.I would also like to tell the people who kept saying they got fooled by Amazon, they didn't got Airpods as it was mentioned...my dear it was already mentioned Earpods and not Airpods, there's the difference between Ear and Air. Apple calls the normal Earphones as Earpods and the bluetooth one's are called Airpods.Will update after a month of usage.

  Coming from iPhone se (2016), this one feels heavenly in terms of camera(nightmode and ultrawide feature being amazing) , display quality.Performance of A13 bionic is good, though I never faced slowness in A9 chipset as well. The battery serves me for 1 whole day which is 3 times better than iphone SE.I still find the 6.1‚Äù size little big for me, iphone 12 mini would have been perfect for my experience but  didn‚Äôt want to spend 20k more for smaller form factor.Hoping that iphone 11 would be my companion for more than 3 years as iPhone SE served me for 3 years.

If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.4. The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation

  I have used both Android and iOS devices in the past. In fact before purchasing iPhone 11 I had Samsung S10. Working as a Software Engineer I know how important the Data Security is and we all know when it comes to privacy, no brand can beat Ô£ø.Pros:1. Camera Performance is absolutely great! Check out some photos that I have clicked.2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge.3. With the power of Apple‚Äôs A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well.Cons:1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display.2. Bezels are thick and looks old fashionedApart from these I don‚Äôt feel there are any concerns.

  First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.

  After using it for around 10 months, now I‚Äôm giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don‚Äôt want to shift to an Android device. I don‚Äôt gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you‚Äôre addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it‚Äôs like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period.

  Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me.

  Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured!

But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!üòä

  I‚Äôll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps.

You need to turn the phone on to look for anything you have missed when you were away from the phone.  No fingerprint sensor.  No smart dial or i am yet to explore the option. The earpods which came with the phone is all plastic and not useful for long hours of music. May be they are made that way.

This phone has no fingerprint scanner.2. The camera app must have some exclusive features.3. The phone migration feature was troublesome for me.

  Upgraded from iPhone 6s 32 GB. Great Cameras (Wide, Ultrawide, and portrait modes). Exceptional battery life (Works up to 7 to 8 hours on iOS 14). Seamless experience. The phone is slightly heavier compared to the 6s. A faster chip (A13 Bionic). Face ID is great. WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great. This phone is highly recommended instead of the 12, due to the battery size (iPhone 11 has 3110 mAh, iPhone 12 only has only 2815 mAh).

  iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos

Except the charger issue it must have been a rapid charger instead of this 5 watt charger its still ok it takes 4-5 hours to charge completely.

  Its obvious how amazing this product is otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this review. I would like to shed some light on how amazing Amazon is. I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!

  Only one word for this phone - it's a beast. Battery life is really good. I charge it once in 2 days with minimal usage (4-5 hours with personal hotspot on). Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers

  iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.
